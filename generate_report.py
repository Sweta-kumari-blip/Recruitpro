    ("Executive Summary", [
        "RECRUITPRO is a modern, web-based recruitment platform designed to connect job seekers with employers efficiently and securely. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for searching and applying for jobs, as well as tools for employers to post job listings and manage applications. Built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, RECRUITPRO emphasizes accessibility, privacy, and a streamlined hiring process.",
        "This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the RECRUITPRO website, including its architecture, features, code quality, user experience, security, and recommendations for future improvements. The analysis is based on a thorough review of the codebase and the website's user interface.",
        "Key findings include: a clear separation of job seeker and employer functionalities, secure handling of user data and job applications (with some areas for improvement), responsive and modern UI design, and opportunities for enhanced security, scalability, and user engagement."
    ]),
    ("Introduction", [
        "Recruitment platforms have become essential tools for both job seekers and employers in the digital age. They streamline the hiring process, reduce time-to-hire, and provide access to a wider talent pool. RECRUITPRO aims to address these needs by offering a robust, easy-to-use platform for job searching and recruitment.",
        "The primary objectives of this report are to: analyze the technical and functional aspects of the RECRUITPRO website, evaluate the user experience and interface design, assess the security and privacy measures in place, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement."
    ]),
    ("Website Architecture", [
        "The RECRUITPRO project is organized as follows: proj.php (main landing page, job search, and application logic), about.php (About, Privacy Policy, and Terms & Conditions), projadd.php (job posting form for employers), recruiter_register.php & recruiter_login.php (employer registration and login), search_jobs.php, fetch_jobs.php, get_jobs.php (backend scripts for job search and retrieval), proj.css, recruiter.css (stylesheets for the main site and recruiter pages), proj.js (intended for JavaScript logic).",
        "Technology Stack: Frontend (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), Backend (PHP, MySQL), AJAX for dynamic job search and application.",
        "Data Flow: Users interact with the frontend forms and search fields. AJAX requests are sent to PHP backend scripts for job search and application. Data is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database."
    ]),
    ("Feature-by-Feature Analysis", [
        "Job Search: Users can search for jobs by skills, experience, and location. The search is performed via AJAX, calling search_jobs.php, which queries the job_listings table and returns results as JSON.",
        "Job Application: Applicants can apply for jobs directly from the job cards. Applications are submitted via POST to proj.php, which inserts the application into the job_applications table.",
        "Employer Portal: Employers can register (recruiter_register.php) and log in (recruiter_login.php). After logging in, employers can post new jobs using projadd.php, which inserts job details into the job_listings table.",
        "User Authentication: Job seekers use modal forms for registration and login (handled client-side with localStorage). Employers have a dedicated registration and login system, with passwords hashed using PHP's password_hash().",
        "Privacy and Terms: The about.php page provides clear privacy policy and terms & conditions, emphasizing data protection and user rights."
    ]),
    ("Code Analysis", [
        "PHP: Uses MySQLi for database interactions. Prepared statements are used for inserting applications and recruiter registration, reducing SQL injection risk. Some scripts (e.g., job search) use string interpolation for SQL, which could be improved for security.",
        "JavaScript: Handles UI interactivity, modals, and AJAX job search. Registration and login for job seekers are managed via localStorage, which is not secure for production use.",
        "CSS: Modern, responsive design with custom styles for both main site and recruiter pages. Uses Google Fonts for a professional look."
    ]),
    ("Database Design", [
        "Main Tables: job_listings (stores job title, description, skills, experience, and location), job_applications (stores job ID, applicant name, and email), recruiters (stores employer name, email, and hashed password).",
        "Relationships: Each job application references a job listing via job_id. Recruiters can post multiple jobs."
    ]),
    ("UI/UX Review", [
        "Clean, modern interface with clear navigation. Responsive design adapts to mobile and desktop. Use of modals for login/registration enhances user experience. Color scheme and typography are consistent and professional."
    ]),
    ("Security and Privacy", [
        "Passwords for recruiters are securely hashed. Some SQL queries could be further secured with prepared statements. Job seeker authentication via localStorage is not secure for sensitive data. Privacy policy is clear and user-focused."
    ]),
    ("User Journey Mapping", [
        "Job Seeker Flow: 1. Visit main page. 2. Search for jobs using filters. 3. Apply for jobs via form. 4. Register/login via modal (localStorage).",
        "Employer Flow: 1. Register as a recruiter. 2. Log in to access job posting form. 3. Post new jobs. 4. Manage job listings (future improvement)."
    ]),
    ("Screenshots and Walkthroughs", [
        "Screenshots would be included here if provided. For now, this section can describe the UI flow and reference the code for each page."
    ]),
    ("Competitive Analysis", [
        "RECRUITPRO offers a focused, streamlined experience compared to larger platforms. Unique selling points: simplicity, clear privacy policy, and modern design."
    ]),
    ("Recommendations", [
        "Use prepared statements for all SQL queries. Move job seeker authentication to server-side for better security. Add features for employers to manage applications. Implement email notifications for applications. Enhance accessibility for users with disabilities."
    ]),
    ("Appendices", [
        "Full code listings (see attached files). Privacy policy and terms (from about.php). Database schema diagrams (to be generated if needed)."
